## Requirements

This extension should work on **all platforms**. It requires a project server to be listening on `wss://localhost:8305`. This server can only run on Linux for now.

<details>

**<summary>How to change an extension setting.</summary>**

</details>

__A) You have a local VM running Linux__

<details> 

**<summary>Installation instructions</summary>**

Install the [inoxd daemon](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/blob/master/docs/inox-daemon.md) to start the project server automatically __(recommended)__ or start it manually with the following command: `inox project-server &`.

**Make sure to forward the TCP port 8305 to the VM.**

</details>

__B) You have a local machine running Linux__

<details> 

**<summary>Installation instructions</summary>**

The extension will automatically start the project server. By default the launch command is `inox project-server`, and projects
are stored in `$HOME/inox-projects`. You can change the launch command in the settings: for configuring the projects' location
add `-config={"projectsDir":"/home/username/other-dir"}`. **It is recommended to update the launch command setting before creating any project.**

<!-- You can either install the [inoxd daemon](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/blob/master/docs/inox-daemon.md) to start the project server automatically __(recommended)__ -->

</details>

__C) You have a remote machine running Linux (e.g VPS)__

<details> 

**<summary>Installation instructions</summary>**

**‚ö†Ô∏è This setup is not recommended for now: the Inox binary is not production ready and probably has memory leaks.**

- Install the [inoxd daemon](https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/blob/master/docs/inox-daemon.md) to start the project server automatically.
- Update the **WebSocket Endpoint** setting to the following value: `wss://<server-ip>:8305`

</details>


## Usage

**Creating a project**

- Create a folder (example: `inox-web-app`)
- Open the folder in a **new VSCode window**
- Execute the VSCode command `Inox: Create New Project in Current Folder`

üëâ If you created the project server **after** having opened the folder you can use the command `Developer: Reload Window` to restart the LSP client.

**Opening a project**

- The first time open the `<name>.code-workspace` file and click on the floating button '**Open Workspace**'
- Subsequent times you can directly go in **File** > **Open Recent**:

The connection status to the server is indicated near the bottom right corner of the window. If the connection is established
the status should be the following:\
